Adds `Makefile` language to [Zed][].

To configure hard tabs, spaced to 4 you'll need to add the following to your Zed settings file:

```json
"language_overrides": {
  "Make": {
    "hard_tabs": true,
    "tab_size": 4
  },
}
```

(If you already have a `"language_overrides"` key defined, just add `"Make": {â€¦}` inside it.)
