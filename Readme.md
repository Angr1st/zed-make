To configure hard tabs, 4 spaces wide you'll need to add the following to your Zed settings file:

```json
"language_overrides": {
  "Make": {
    "hard_tabs": true,
    "tab_size": 4
  },
}
```

(If you already have a `"language_overrides"` key defined, just add `"Make": {â€¦}` inside it.)

## Development

Use Zed's extensions manager (`zed: extensions`) to add this as a dev extension and reload it when you've edited on disk. It'll compile the grammar correctly for you then.

## License

See `LICENSE`.
